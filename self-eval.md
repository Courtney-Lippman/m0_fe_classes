# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I definitely struggled but I would say it was a productive struggle. I found that I could apply everything that I learned this week into the CFU with ease.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
My workflow is great. I find that the Pomodoro technique really helps with my productivity.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I need to make sure that my workflow is polished for when I start. I also need to make sure that my work space is ready to go and than I have everything that I need. I feel like I need to support of my family/friends (which I have) and continue to get the fantastic support from my peers.
